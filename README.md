# formtastic-bootstrap

Two great tastes in one: Formtastic and the Twitter Bootstrap framework.


# About the Implementation

Way too much code copied from Formtastic (behavior and classes.)
Tried to mimic its code structure as much as possible.

## Getting Started

## Major Difference in Behavior

## Contributing to formtastic-bootstrap
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
